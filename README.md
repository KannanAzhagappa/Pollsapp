# polls

React real-time voting app with Firebase backend.

## Use cases

- As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them
- As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
- As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
- As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
- As an authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
- As an authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form.
- As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

---- Limitations:

1. Different kind of users
2. Start date and end date integration
3. Option removal in update (we only provided addition but not removal of existing options)
